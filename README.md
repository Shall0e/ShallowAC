# ShallowAC
v2.1.1 (5/14/2022) One of the ***best*** MCBE Anti-Cheats, with over 100 downloads and extremely helpful and powerful tools.

# How can ShallowAC help with my server/realm?
We have MANY moderator tools for managing members, such as;
   - Freeze
   - Inventory View *(Shows admins a certain users inventory (only says NAMES of items, not enchantments.))*
   - Admin-Grab *(Pick up members and entities using a blaze rod, ONLY WORKS FOR ADMINS!!!)*
   - Error-Logs *(Records and reports problems found running the anticheat.)*
   - Member auto-monitor *(Set a certain person for the anticheat to focus on, when something is detected near them, they are instantly banned.)*
   - Insta-Spawn *(Creates a premade spawn with built-in spawn protection and kits, you can pick from survival, creative, modern, medieval, and more!)*
   - And Much more! *(More tools coming soon...)*

# What can ShallowAC do?
We have features such as;
   - Anti-Fly *(When floating too long without permission, the Anti-Fly will forcefully place you back down.)*
   - Anti-CBE *(Detects entities that may be used to cause harm.)*
   - Anti-GM *(Stops and warns a user for changing gamemodes without permission.)*
   - Backup systems *(Just in case the other systems fail, very rarely.)*

These modules are very powerful, and can stop whole servers from being griefed!

# Is ShallowAC better than most other anticheats?
Well, I'm not the judge of that, that's your job to find out, but we can tell you what makes us a good anticheat!
   1. Quick Updates/Bug fixes, we are by FAR the fastest updating anticheat, always working to fix bugs and add new features.
   2. Useful moderator tools, just look up and you'll see why.
   3. Better support, we are VERY quick to respond to questions and/or support, have a problem? We'll fix it!
   4. Better usabililty, anyone can just download the anticheat, add it to the world, and use it instantly! No setup needed!

# Why should I use ShallowAC?
Compared to other anticheats, ShallowAC is by far the most versitile in most situations,

Running an anarchy realm? We got things to support no rules!

Running a Creative realm? We got settings for you!
Survival server? Yup!

PVP? Yes!

If you aren't looking for any of that, then we got other custom settings.

Dynamic Lighting, hold a torch in your hand to have it light up around you.
Random fun commands! Such as "Troll", "FakeJoin"/"FakeLeave", "Rickroll", "Vanish".
